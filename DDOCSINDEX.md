Poodinis is a dependency injection framework for the D programming language. It is inspired by the Spring Framework and Hypodermic IoC container for C++. Poodinis supports registering and resolving classes either by concrete type or interface. Automatic injection of dependencies is supported through the use of UDAs (Referred to as autowiring).

For instructions on how to use Poodinis in your projects, read the [readme](https://github.com/mbierlee/poodinis/blob/master/README.md).
